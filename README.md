# Costume-Chatbox-Terminal
This project implements a custom Twitch chat overlay designed to resemble a terminal-style interface for Streamlabs. It allows Twitch chat messages to be displayed in a retro, green-on-black terminal format, enhancing the visual style of streams. The chat messages are styled to include a blinking cursor, typing animation, and retro CRT scanlines for a nostalgic, old-school computing feel.

## Key Features:
Terminal-style display: Messages appear as if typed into a classic terminal window.

Typing animation: Each message is revealed letter-by-letter for a more immersive effect.

Blinking cursor: A blinking â–ˆ simulates the terminal typing experience.

Retro scanline overlay: A visual effect that mimics the look of a CRT monitor, adding authenticity.

Customizable fonts: Choose from multiple fonts to match the terminal aesthetic (e.g., "Press Start 2P", "VT323").

This chatbox is fully customizable and can be integrated into Streamlabs to enhance the interactivity of your stream by displaying chat messages in a stylish, retro format.
